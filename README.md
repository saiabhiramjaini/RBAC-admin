      - Email: Text field (should be unique)
      - Mobile No.: Text field (minimum of 10 characters)
      - Gender: Radio buttons
      - Status: Dropdown
      - Roles: Checkbox
      - Image Upload: Only JPG/PNG
   **So Admin can add all the employee details and assign roles and set a status for them.**

5. **Employee List Page** (`/employeelist`)
    - Search functionality considers all fields in the table
    - List of employees with `Edit` and `Delete` actions
    - Clicking `Edit` passes the employee's ID as a parameter to the Update Employee Page

6. **Update Employee Page** (`/update/:id`)
    - On load, the employee's data is fetched using the `id` and pre-filled in the form
    - Admin can edit the initial values
   **Here Admin can change the details along wwith status and permissions as well**

### Authentication Check (isLoggedIn):

- The isLoggedIn variable is used to check if a user is authenticated by checking if the username exists in localStorage.
- If username is present in localStorage, the user is considered logged in.
- If the user is logged in (isLoggedIn is true), they are redirected to the `/home` route using `<Navigate to="/home" replace />`


## Common Package

This package is used for **type safety**. It declares types and schemas that are used across both the frontend and backend.

### Link
- [NPM Package Link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@abhiram2k03/rbac-common)

### Types & Enums
- **loginSchema** and **Login type**
- **employeeSchema** and **Employee type**
- **genderEnum**
- **permissionsEnum**
- **statusEnum**

All necessary validations are handled in this common package.

### NPM Package
This folder is uploaded to NPM under the name `@abhiram2k03/rbac-common`.
  
To install:
```
npm i @abhiram2k03/rbac-common
```

## Server Structure

The server follows the **MVC architecture**.

### Link
- [API link](https://server-rbac.abhiramverse.tech/)

### Authentication Routes: `/api/v1/auth`

1. **`POST /signup`** - `createUser`
   - Parses username and password using `loginSchema`.
   - Hashes the password using bcrypt.
   - Creates a new user if the username is unique.
   - Generates a JWT token and stores it in a cookie.
   - Response: User creation success or validation error.


2. **`POST /login`** - `loginUser`
   - Parses username and password using `loginSchema`.
   - Verifies if the user exists and compares the password.
   - If authenticated, a JWT token is generated and stored in a cookie.
   - Response: Login success or error if credentials are incorrect.
     

3. **`GET /logout`** - `logoutUser`
   - Clears the authentication cookie (JWT token).
   - Response: Logout success.



### Employee Management Routes:  `/api/v1/employee`

1. **`POST /employee`** - `createEmployee`
   - Protected route (requires authentication).
   - Validates employee data with `employeeSchema`.
   - Checks if an employee with the provided email already exists.
   - Creates a new employee if validation passes.
   - Response: Employee creation success or validation error.
     

2. **`GET /employee`** - `getEmployees`
   - Protected route (requires authentication).
   - Retrieves a list of all employees.
   - Response: JSON array of employees or an error.
     

3. **`GET /employee/:id`** - `getEmployee`
   - Protected route (requires authentication).
   - Fetches a specific employee by ID.
   - Response: JSON object of the employee or an error.
     

4. **`PUT /employee/:id`** - `updateEmployee`
   - Protected route (requires authentication).
   - Validates employee data with `employeeSchema`.
   - Updates the employeeâ€™s data by ID.
   - Response: Employee update success or validation error.
     

5. **`DELETE /employee/:id`** - `deleteEmployee`
   - Protected route (requires authentication).
   - Deletes an employee by ID.
   - Response: Employee deletion success or error if not found.
     

### Auth Middleware:
- Checks if a valid JWT token is stored in cookies.
- Verifies the token and finds the corresponding user.
- Proceeds with the request if the user is authenticated.


## Database Choice
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **ODM (Object Document Mapper)**: Mongoose
- **Collections**: 2 primary collections

### Collection 1: Login Collection
- **Model Name**: Login
- **Purpose**: User authentication and login management
- **Key Fields**:
  - `username`: Unique identifier for user login
  - `password`: Stored credentials (To maintain privacy, this is be hashed)
- **Automatic Tracking**: 
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp of user account creation
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp of last user account modification

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9bc7efa-e744-41e2-8947-88d72376b5ad)

### Collection 2: Employee Collection
- **Model Name**: Employee
- **Purpose**: Store comprehensive employee information
- **Key Fields**:
  - `name`: Full name of the employee
  - `email`: Unique identifier for each employee (enforced as unique)
  - `mobile`: Contact number
  - `gender`: Restricted to predefined gender options
  - `permissions`: Array of access permissions
  - `status`: Current employment status
  - `image`: Employee profile image path or identifier
- **Automatic Tracking**:
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp of employee record creation
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp of last employee record modification

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a084c774-82f9-4725-9d9c-12ab2991e971)


### Key Design Characteristics
- Strict schema validation using Mongoose
- Enum-based restrictions on certain fields (gender, permissions, status)
- Unique constraints on sensitive fields like email
- Automatic timestamp management
- Modular approach with separate schemas for different entities

#### Steps Followed:
1. Created a **Dockerfile** and verified the image by building it locally.
2. Set up two GitHub workflows: `build.yaml` and `deploy.yaml`.
3. Created a new repository on **Docker Hub** for `deploy.yaml`.

6. Installed **Docker** on the instance.
7. Updated the security rules to allow access on port `8080`.
8. Installed **Nginx** to serve as a reverse proxy.
9. Used **Certbot** to set up an SSL certificate for secure communication.
